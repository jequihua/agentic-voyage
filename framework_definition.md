# Artifact-First Agentic ML Workflow Framework

## Overview

This framework defines a structured approach to developing data science and machine learning projects using AI-assisted workflows.

It integrates:
- Structured context engineering (folder-based workflows)
- Artifact-driven development
- Controlled use of AI agents
- Iterative review and convergence
- Minimal but effective instruction design

The goal is to maximize:
- **clarity**
- **traceability**
- **reviewability**
- **reproducibility**
- **useful automation**

while avoiding:
- excessive orchestration complexity
- hidden system state
- over-reliance on prompts or agent personalities

---

## Core Principle

> The unit of progress is not an agent completing a task.  
> The unit of progress is an artifact advancing from one reviewable state to another.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Artifact-Centered Development

Artifacts are the primary outputs of the system.  
Each meaningful step in the project produces or updates an artifact.

Examples:
- problem brief
- dataset documentation
- exploratory analysis summaries
- experiment plans
- run summaries
- error analyses
- model cards
- stakeholder reports

Artifacts are:
- human-readable
- version-controlled
- reviewable
- reusable

---

### 2. Workspace-Based Context

The project is divided into **workspaces**, each representing a mode of work.

Each workspace:
- defines its own context
- has clear objectives
- produces specific artifacts

Workspaces act as **context boundaries** that limit what the AI needs to consider.

---

### 3. Minimal Global Instructions

A root instruction file (e.g., `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`) provides:

- project identity
- workspace map
- core commands
- essential constraints

It should:
- be concise
- avoid redundancy
- act as a routing layer, not a knowledge base

---

### 4. Localized Context (Per Workspace)

Each workspace contains a `CONTEXT.md` file defining:

- purpose of the workspace
- expected outputs
- evaluation criteria
- relevant files
- common pitfalls

This is where detailed guidance lives.

---

### 5. Role-Based AI Usage

AI is used in clearly defined roles:

#### Maker
- Generates code, analysis, or artifacts
- Performs implementation and iteration

#### Reviewer(s)
- Critiques outputs
- Identifies issues and improvements
- Evaluates correctness, clarity, and completeness

#### Synthesizer
- Merges multiple reviews
- Produces structured conclusions
- Distinguishes between agreement, disagreement, and uncertainty

---

### 6. Convergent Review Process

Instead of accumulating opinions, the system enforces convergence:

1. Output is produced
2. Independent reviews are performed
3. Reviews are merged into structured categories:
   - agreed issues
   - disagreements
   - improvements
4. Disagreements are resolved through evidence
5. Final decisions are recorded

---

### 7. Skills (Reusable Workflows)

Skills represent repeatable processes with defined inputs and outputs.

Examples:
- exploratory data analysis checklist
- experiment review
- error analysis
- notebook-to-report transformation
- regression testing

Skills:
- reduce prompt variability
- standardize workflows
- improve consistency

---

### 8. Selective Tool Integration (MCP)

External tools are used only when necessary.

Typical use cases:
- experiment tracking systems
- data warehouses
- documentation platforms
- issue trackers

The repository remains the primary source of truth.

---

### 9. Version-Controlled Development

All artifacts and code are:
- stored in version control (e.g., Git)
- diffable
- reviewable over time

Git acts as:
- memory
- audit trail
- comparison system

---

## System Architecture

The framework is composed of five layers:

### Layer 1 — Project Operating System
- root instructions
- workspace definitions
- naming conventions
- core commands

### Layer 2 — Workspaces
- structured folders
- localized context
- task-specific environments

### Layer 3 — Artifacts
- outputs of each step
- review surfaces
- decision anchors

### Layer 4 — Agent Roles
- maker
- reviewers
- synthesizer

### Layer 5 — Tooling
- external systems (via MCP)
- experiment tracking
- data access

---

## Workspace Model

A standard project structure consists of five core workspaces:

### 00_brief — Problem Definition
Defines:
- objectives
- constraints
- target metrics
- assumptions
- non-goals

---

### 01_data — Data Understanding
Defines:
- data sources
- schema
- data quality
- leakage risks
- splits
- feature provenance

---

### 02_analysis — Exploration
Contains:
- exploratory analysis
- visualizations
- hypotheses
- observations
- notebooks and summaries

---

### 03_experiments — Experimentation
Contains:
- experiment plans
- configurations
- results
- comparisons
- error analyses

---

### 04_delivery — Outputs
Contains:
- stakeholder summaries
- model documentation
- deployment preparation
- monitoring plans

---

## Artifact Lifecycle

Artifacts evolve through stages:

1. Initial creation
2. Iterative refinement
3. Review and critique
4. Consolidation
5. Finalization

Artifacts are never “final” — they remain editable and versioned.

---

## Execution Flow

A typical workflow:

1. Define or update an artifact
2. Execute work within a workspace
3. Produce or update outputs
4. Run review process
5. Resolve issues
6. Record decisions
7. Move to next step

---

## Design Principles

### Clarity Over Cleverness
Prefer simple, inspectable systems over complex orchestration.

### Local Context Over Global Context
Keep context scoped to relevant workspaces.

### Artifacts Over Hidden State
All important outputs should be visible and editable.

### Reuse Over Repetition
Convert repeated workflows into skills.

### Minimalism Over Exhaustiveness
Avoid unnecessary instructions or structure.

### Evidence Over Opinion
Decisions should be based on artifacts and results.

## Comparison to Other Approaches

| Approach | Difference |
|----------|-----------|
| Multi-agent systems | Focus on autonomy rather than artifact traceability |
| Folder-based context | Focus on stages rather than artifact lifecycle |
| Git-native agents | Focus on portability rather than workflow simplicity |
| Minimal instruction | Focus on reducing context rather than structuring work |

---

## Intended Use Cases

This framework is particularly suited for:

- data science projects
- machine learning experimentation
- research workflows
- iterative analytical work
- human-in-the-loop systems

---

## Limitations

- Requires discipline in maintaining artifacts
- May feel slower initially due to structure
- Less optimized for real-time multi-agent collaboration
- Requires adaptation for highly dynamic systems

---

## Summary

This framework defines a structured, artifact-centered approach to agentic workflows.

It combines:
- structured context
- clear outputs
- controlled AI roles
- iterative review
- versioned development

The result is a system that prioritizes:
- transparency
- reliability
- and long-term usability
